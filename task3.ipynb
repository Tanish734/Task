On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output \"12\" as result.\n",

Although, Python doesn't require data types to be defined explicitly during variable declarations type errors are likely to occur if the knowledge of data types and their compatibility with each other are neglected. Python provides type() and isinstance() functions to check the type of these variables. These data types can be grouped into the following categories-\n",
